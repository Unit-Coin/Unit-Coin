Unit-Coin
=====================================

What is UNIT?
----------------

UNIT is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. UNIT uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Unit Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency. This project is based on the work
of The Litecoin Core Developers and the Bitcoin Core Developers.

This project was initially developed inside the #TeamAcher.
